# Product Development

Collaborated with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to guide them through planning and execution. Managed stakeholder expectations and handled risks that arise, reprioritized feature and sprint priorities to tackle competing requests.

Problem:
Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times.

Task was to build a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).
